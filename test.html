	MiHoYo's giant cash cow... I have a lot to say about this and other
	gacha games...
</p>
<p>I'll begin with the big thing, the gacha, but I'll be brief about it.</p>
<p>
	<p>
		<b>Premise: On every gacha I've played, I've always been a F2P. 
			And it will not change anytime soon.</b> 
	</p>
	<p>
		I simply don't like wasting money for a <i>small chance</i> of 
		getting a character (or equipment), and I consider this genre of 
		live-service games to be a subset of <i>pay-to-win games</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
	Yes, there are some good things that can be done without spending money,
	just with what the game gives you, but it's just not comparable to a
	META approach. It's just a ploy to get you to spend money on their
	virtual slot-machines.
	</p>
</p>
<p>Luckily, I was not addicted to this style of playing gachas, and I saved,
planned and speculated on upcoming banners.</p>
<p>
	<b>I consider a gacha to be "beaten" when:</b>
	<ul>
		<li>I have all the characters that I like/want (optional)</li>
		<li>I have at least one good and reliable way to beat most of the <i>primary game content</i> (e.g. story)</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	I can say that I have "beaten" every gacha game that I actually "like", if I stay by that definition.
